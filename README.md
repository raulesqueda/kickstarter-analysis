# Kickstarter-analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
Louise, you have to taking into account the amount of money you need to starting a play in the US, remember, the market is quite different than in the GB. Also, remember, in the GB the goverment can give you many helps for your play. Maybe you should think in other kind of project where you need less money.

# Overview of Project
## The goal of this project is know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch date and the funding goals, make recommendations to anyone who wants to know this relations and know the real possibilities to start a campaign with Kickstarter to founding a play.
# Analysis and Challenges
## For this analysis we used a database with information of crowdfunding projects in 21 countries in -Kickstarter. First, we want to know about the relation between the launch date of the Kickstarter for theater campaigns and the status (successful, failed and canceled) in the Great Britain, the “successful” campaigns represents 61% of the total and had more success in the months from May to July.

## Second, we want to know about the number of projects with the same status (successful, failed and canceled), in the subcategory “plays” with the information of all the countries and classified by 12 ranges of the campaign goal. The results show that the percentage of “successful” campaigns was in goals between “less than 1000” and “1000 to 4999”. On the other hand, the “failed” campaigns has a higher percentage in the range between “45000 to 49999” and “50000 and more”.

## To getting these results, we analyzed the database and we had to make date conversions in excel and adding columns to separate information, this took some hours to get the information as we need it for the analysis. 
# Results
## In conclusion, we saw that the launch date of theater campaigns show that the “successful” campaigns occurs between the months of May to July, this probably has a relation with the availability of money after Mother’s Day. Also, the worst months to start a campaign were November and December, this could have a relation with the holidays and the spending, for example, in gifts for the season. 
## Otherwise, the status and the range of campaigns goals show that the campaigns with a goal less than 4999 had more “success” than the campaigns that the goal surpasses 45000.
## In addition to, we have to work with the database and making some conversions and separate information, maybe in other analysis we can analyze more countries and making comparisons with the amount of the campaign goals to have other points of view.
